# Knight Rider

## About

Knight Rider is a free ride sharing app to help students and faculty at Middle Georgia State University commute between the 5 campuses by catching rides with each other. The project was part of an initiative to help the university community find more cost effective and efficient ways of traveling between the 5 campuses across middle Georgia.

## How it works

Knight Rider allows university students to sign up for a profile using their school email. Once logged in, students can either join rides or create them. If they choose to join a ride, they can search for them. If they choose to create a ride, they can make one describing their origin and destination, as well as departure time. When students join a ride, they are put into a group chat where they can communicate with each other and coordinate their ride.

> Apologies in advance for the poor design. This was my first major iOS project I ever worked on :)
